# Completion Response Rules

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Keep Responses Concise

**RULE**: When completing tasks, provide ONLY essential information. No lengthy summaries unless explicitly requested.

### ❌ WRONG - Too Long:
- Multi-paragraph explanations
- Detailed descriptions of every change
- Redundant status updates
- Repeating what was already discussed

### ✅ CORRECT - Concise:
```
Task complete. Files organized, docker-compose uses root .env, 3 services tested.
```

### When to Provide Details:
- User explicitly asks for explanation
- Critical issues encountered
- Non-obvious changes made

### Focus On:
- Fix the immediate issue user mentioned
- Don't explain what you already did
- Address only NEW problems
