├─ Agent 3: Claude scores sentiment
├─ Agent 4: Claude assesses impact
├─ Agent 5: Create MarketEvent in Neo4j
└─ Agent 6: Link to affected companies

Result: Intelligent news classification operational
```

**Native LangGraph Service:**
```python
# axiom-langgraph-ma (Running 5+ hours, no Airflow!)
Workflow:
├─ Query Neo4j for company data
├─ Claude analyzes acquisition potential
├─ Continuous 5-minute cycles
└─ Self-orchestrating service

Demonstrates: LangGraph can orchestrate itself
```

### DSPy Prompt Optimization

**Professional M&A Intelligence:**

// Find highly correlated stocks
MATCH (s1:Stock)-[r:CORRELATED_WITH]->(s2:Stock)
WHERE r.coefficient > 0.8
RETURN s1.symbol, s2.symbol, r.coefficient
ORDER BY r.coefficient DESC

// 775K+ edges available for analysis!
```
