## üèóÔ∏è AI ARCHITECTURE LAYERS

### **Layer 1: AI Framework Selection & Integration**

**Primary Framework: LangGraph (Orchestration)**
- Why: Best for stateful multi-agent workflows
- Use: Coordinate between different AI agents
- Status: Integrated

**LLM Integration: LangChain (Abstraction)**
- Why: Provider-agnostic, proven patterns
- Use: Abstract different LLM providers
- Status: Ready for integration

**Vector Store: ChromaDB (Memory)**
- Why: Fast, open-source, embedded
- Use: Pattern matching, historical learning
- Status: Integrated

**ML Framework: PyTorch (Models)**
- Why: Flexible, production-ready
- Use: All custom ML models
- Status: Used throughout

### **Layer 2: Multi-Agent System**

**Agent Types:**

**1. Pricing Agent**
- Responsibility: Calculate Greeks, price options
- Model: Ultra-fast neural networks
- Safety: Validate vs Black-Scholes
- Fallback: Analytical pricing if NN fails

**2. Risk Agent**
- Responsibility: Monitor risk, alert on breaches
- Model: Risk metrics calculation
- Safety: Multiple VaR methods (cross-validation)
- Fallback: Conservative limits if models disagree

**3. Strategy Agent**
- Responsibility: Generate trade ideas
- Model: RL for strategy selection
- Safety: Validate strategies make sense
- Fallback: Template-based strategies

**4. Execution Agent**
- Responsibility: Route orders optimally
- Model: RL for venue selection
- Safety: Validate routing logic
- Fallback: Simple NBBO routing

**5. Monitoring Agent**
- Responsibility: Watch all other agents
- Model: Anomaly detection
- Safety: Alert if any agent behaves abnormally
- Fallback: Human escalation

**6. Guardrail Agent**
- Responsibility: Final safety check
- Model: Rule-based + ML
- Safety: Veto dangerous actions
- Fallback: Always conservative

### **Layer 4: Monitoring & Observability**

**Model Performance:**
- Accuracy tracking (vs ground truth)
- Latency monitoring (real-time)
- Drift detection (Evidently)
- A/B testing framework

**Agent Behavior:**
- Decision logging (all actions recorded)

- Interaction monitoring (agent-to-agent)
- Performance dashboards

**System Health:**
- Overall system metrics
- Resource utilization
- Error rates
- SLA compliance

---

### **Layer 5: Security & Compliance**

**Model Security:**
- Model versioning (MLflow)
- Access control (who can deploy)
- Audit trail (all changes logged)
- Rollback capability

**Data Security:**
- Encryption at rest
- Encryption in transit
- Data anonymization
- Access logging

**Compliance:**
- Explainable AI (SHAP values)
- Bias detection
- Fair lending compliance
- Regulatory reporting

## üîê AI GUARDRAILS IMPLEMENTATION

**Pre-Execution Checks:**
1. Input validation (range, type, sanity)
2. Rate limiting (per client, per agent)
3. Permission checking (authorization)
4. Resource availability (GPU, memory)

**During Execution:**
1. Timeout enforcement (max execution time)
2. Resource monitoring (prevent runaway)
3. Intermediate validation (check progress)
4. Circuit breaker (stop if errors)

**Post-Execution Checks:**
1. Output validation (sanity checks)
2. Cross-validation (multiple models)
3. Audit logging (record all actions)
4. Performance tracking (latency, accuracy)

## üìä DECISION FRAMEWORK

**When to Use AI:**
‚úì High-frequency calculations (Greeks, pricing)  
‚úì Pattern recognition (arbitrage, order flow)  
‚úì Optimization (spreads, hedging)  
‚úì Prediction (volatility, regimes)

**When NOT to Use AI:**
‚úó Life-critical decisions (use rules + human)  
‚úó Regulatory calculations (use approved methods)  
‚úó Novel situations (insufficient training data)  
‚úó When simple rules work (Occam's razor)

## üéØ NEXT: IMPLEMENT AI SAFETY LAYERS

I'll now build:
1. AI Guardrail system
2. Multi-agent coordinator
3. Model monitoring framework
4. Safety validation tools
5. Explainability modules

This ensures our AI is production-safe for $10M/year clients.
