# Derivatives Platform - Next Phase Work Plan

## Systematic Execution: Performance Validation → Optimization → Deployment

**Current Status:** Foundation complete, code written, ready for validation  
**Next Phase:** Prove performance, optimize, prepare for production  
**Timeline:** 4 weeks of focused execution  
**Outcome:** Production-ready system with validated <100 microsecond performance

---

## 📋 WEEK 1: PERFORMANCE BASELINE & VALIDATION

### **Day 1: Environment Verification**

**Morning (2 hours):**
```bash
# Verify Python environment
python3 --version  # Should be 3.10+
which python3

# Check if virtual environment exists
ls -la venv/

# If exists, activate
source venv/bin/activate

# If not exists, create
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
```

**Afternoon (3 hours):**
```bash
# Install derivatives requirements
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
pip install -r requirements-derivatives.txt

# Verify critical packages
python -c "import torch; print(f'PyTorch: {torch.__version__}')"
python -c "import torch; print(f'CUDA available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}')"
python -c "from langgraph.graph import StateGraph; print('LangGraph: OK')"
python -c "import chromadb; print('ChromaDB: OK')"
```

**Output:** Document what's installed, what needs fixing

---

### **Day 2: Baseline Performance Test**

**Task:** Run all derivatives modules and document current performance

**Step 1: Test Ultra-Fast Greeks**
```bash
cd axiom/derivatives
python ultra_fast_greeks.py

# Document output:
# - Current latency (microseconds)
# - GPU usage (Y/N)
# - Throughput (calc/sec)
# - Any errors
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Benchmarking UltraFastGreeksEngine (10000 iterations)...
Device: cuda:0 or cpu

BENCHMARK RESULTS
Mean time: XX.XX microseconds
Target <100us: ✓ ACHIEVED or ✗ NOT YET
Speedup vs Bloomberg: XXXXx
```

**Step 2: Test Exotic Options**
```bash
python exotic_pricer.py

# Document:
# - Barrier option time
# - Asian option time
# - Lookback time
# - Binary time
```

**Step 3: Test Volatility Surface**
```bash
python volatility_surface.py

# Document:
# - Surface construction time
# - Arbitrage-free: Yes/No
# - Point lookup time
```

**Step 4: Test Complete Workflow**
```bash
cd ../../demos
python demo_ultra_fast_derivatives.py

# Document:
# - Each component time
# - Total workflow time
# - Any failures
```

**Deliverable:** Performance baseline document with actual measurements

---

### **Day 3: Identify Performance Bottlenecks**

**Profiling:**
```bash
# Install profiling tools
pip install py-spy line-profiler memory-profiler

# Profile Greeks calculation
py-spy record -o greeks_profile.svg -- python -m axiom.derivatives.ultra_fast_greeks

# Line-by-line profiling
kernprof -l -v axiom/derivatives/ultra_fast_greeks.py

# Memory profiling
mprof run python -m axiom.derivatives.ultra_fast_greeks
mprof plot
```

**Analysis Questions:**
1. Is GPU being used? (Check nvidia-smi during run)
2. Where is time spent? (Model load? Inference? Data transfer?)
3. Is quantization applied? (INT8 vs FP32)
4. Is TorchScript compilation working?
5. Are we CPU-bound or GPU-bound?

**Deliverable:** Profiling report identifying top 3 bottlenecks

---

### **Day 4: Quick Wins Implementation**

**Based on profiling, implement obvious optimizations:**

**If CPU-bound:**
```python
# Ensure GPU is actually being used
assert torch.cuda.is_available()
model = model.cuda()
inputs = inputs.cuda()
```

**If model loading is slow:**
```python
# Add @lru_cache or pre-load model
@lru_cache(maxsize=1)
def get_model():
    model = load_and_optimize()
    return model
```

**If data transfer is slow:**
```python
# Keep tensors on GPU
self.device = torch.device('cuda')
# Avoid .cpu() calls in hot path
```

**Deliverable:** 2-3x speedup from quick fixes

---

### **Day 5: Comprehensive Benchmark**

**Run official benchmark:**
```bash
cd tests/derivatives
pytest test_ultra_fast_greeks.py -v --benchmark-only --benchmark-save=baseline

# Generate report
pytest-benchmark compare baseline
```

**Document Results:**
```

```

**Deliverable:** Official benchmark report

**Week 1 Complete:** Know exactly where we stand on performance

---

## ⚡ WEEK 2: PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION

### **Day 6: Model Quantization**

**Implement INT8 quantization:**
```python
# Create: axiom/derivatives/optimizations/__init__.py
# Create: axiom/derivatives/optimizations/quantize.py

import torch
from axiom.derivatives.ultra_fast_greeks import QuantizedGreeksNetwork

def quantize_model(model_fp32_path, output_path):
    """
    Quantize model to INT8
    Expected: 4x speedup
    """
    # Load FP32 model
    model = QuantizedGreeksNetwork()
    # model.load_state_dict(torch.load(model_fp32_path))
    model.eval()
    
    # Apply dynamic quantization
    quantized_model = torch.quantization.quantize_dynamic(
        model,
        {torch.nn.Linear},
        dtype=torch.qint8
    )
    
    # Save
    torch.save(quantized_model.state_dict(), output_path)
    
    # Benchmark before/after
    print("Testing quantized model...")
    # Run benchmark
    
    return quantized_model

if __name__ == "__main__":
    model = quantize_model('greeks_fp32.pth', 'greeks_int8.pth')
    print("✓ Quantization complete, test performance improvement")
```

**Test:**
```bash
python axiom/derivatives/optimizations/quantize.py
# Compare: quantized vs FP32 latency
# Expected: 4x faster
```

---

### **Day 7: TorchScript Optimization**

**Compile model to TorchScript:**
```python
# Add to ultra_fast_greeks.py

def compile_model(model):
    """
    Compile to TorchScript for 2x speedup
    """
    example_input = torch.randn(1, 5).cuda()
    
    # Trace model
    traced = torch.jit.trace(model, example_input)
    
    # Optimize for inference
    optimized = torch.jit.optimize_for_inference(traced)
    
    return optimized
```

**Test:**
```bash
python -c "from axiom.derivatives.ultra_fast_greeks import UltraFastGreeksEngine; e = UltraFastGreeksEngine(); e.benchmark(1000)"
# Compare: TorchScript vs regular
```

---

### **Day 8-9: GPU Optimization**

**If we have NVIDIA GPU with TensorRT:**
```python
# Create: axiom/derivatives/optimizations/tensorrt_compile.py

import torch_tensorrt

def compile_tensorrt(model, example_input):
    """
    Compile to TensorRT
    Expected: 2-5x speedup on NVIDIA GPUs
    """
    trt_model = torch_tensorrt.compile(
        model,
        inputs=[example_input],
        enabled_precisions={torch.float16},  # FP16 for speed
        workspace_size=1 << 30  # 1GB
    )
    
    return trt_model
```

**Alternative (if no TensorRT):**
```python
# Use CUDA optimizations
# - Pin memory
# - Use streams
# - Optimize kernel launches
```

---

### **Day 10: Validation & Documentation**

**Final Week 2 Benchmark:**
```bash
pytest tests/derivatives/test_ultra_fast_greeks.py --benchmark-only

# Document final results:
# - Baseline: XXus
# - After quantization: XXus
# - After TorchScript: XXus
# - After TensorRT: XXus
# - Final: XXus
# - Target: <100us (ideally <50us)
```

**Create Performance Report:**
```markdown
# Performance Optimization Results

    result = workflow.run({...})
    assert result is not None

def test_vector_db_integration():
    """Test ChromaDB pattern matching"""
    pass
```

---
