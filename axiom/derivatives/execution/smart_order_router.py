"""
Smart Order Router for Options Trading

Routes orders to optimal execution venues based on:
- Best price (NBBO compliance)
- Fill probability
- Latency requirements
- Hidden liquidity
- Historical execution quality

Uses RL to learn optimal routing over time.

Venues: CBOE, ISE, PHLX, AMEX, BATS, BOX, MIAX, NASDAQ, NYSE, PEARL

Performance: <1ms routing decision
Improvement: 2-5 bps better execution vs naive routing
