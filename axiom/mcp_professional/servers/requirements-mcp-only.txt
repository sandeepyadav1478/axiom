# Absolute minimal requirements for MCP servers to run
# These servers are just interfaces - the heavy computation happens elsewhere

# Core Python async
aiohttp>=3.9.0

# JSON handling (stdlib should be enough but adding for safety)
python-dotenv>=1.0.0

# For servers that need basic numerical operations
numpy>=1.24.0

# That's it! The MCP servers are just protocol handlers
# They forward requests to the actual engines which run separately
