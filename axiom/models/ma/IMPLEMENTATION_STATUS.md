## 📝 Implementation Notes

### Design Decisions

1. **Risk-Adjusted Discount Rates**: Synergies use 12% vs typical 10% WACC to reflect execution risk
2. **Integration Costs**: Default 15% of annual synergies based on empirical M&A data
3. **Kelly Fraction**: Use 25% of Kelly optimal for safety (industry best practice)
4. **LBO Hold Period**: Default 5 years aligns with typical PE fund lifecycle
5. **Control Premium**: 20-40% range based on academic research (Morck et al.)

### Formulas Implemented

**IRR (Newton-Raphson)**:
```
NPV = Σ(CF_t / (1 + IRR)^t) = 0
IRR_{n+1} = IRR_n - NPV(IRR_n) / NPV'(IRR_n)
```

**WACC**:
```
WACC = (E/V) × r_e + (D/V) × r_d × (1 - T)
```

**Kelly Criterion**:
```
f* = (p × b - q) / b
where p = win prob, q = loss prob, b = win/loss ratio
```

**Implied Probability**:
```
P = (Current - Downside) / (Offer - Downside)
```

**Deal Spread**:
```
Spread = (Offer - Current) / Current
Annualized = Spread × (365 / Days)
```
