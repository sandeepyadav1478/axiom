## 💡 ALTERNATIVE HYBRID STRATEGY

**What if we do BOTH but prioritize Credit?**

**Phase 1 (Months 1-6): Credit Focus**
- Perfect our 20-model credit ensemble
- Sign first 10 credit clients ($5M ARR)
- Prove the AI credit platform
- Build case studies and references

**Phase 2 (Months 7-12): Add Derivatives**
- Use credit revenue to fund derivatives R&D
- Build sub-100us Greeks in parallel
- Target hedge funds first (easier than market makers)
- Differentiate with "credit + derivatives" combo

**Phase 3 (Year 2): Dual Specialization**
- Dominant in credit ($50M+ ARR)
- Strong in derivatives for hedge funds ($20M+ ARR)
- Total: $70M+ ARR, strong position in both

**Benefit:** Diversified revenue, lower risk, proven path
