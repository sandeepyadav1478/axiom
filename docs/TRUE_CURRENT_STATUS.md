# Axiom Project - True Current Status
**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Reality Check:** What Actually Works vs What's Just Code

---

## üéØ DISCOVERY: AI IS INTEGRATED BUT HAS RUNTIME ERRORS

### Test Results (Just Now)
```bash
uv run python -m axiom.main "Test M&A analysis query"

‚úÖ AI Providers initialized (Claude, SGLang)
‚úÖ LangGraph workflow started
‚úÖ Planner node executed
‚ùå Task runner node FAILED
‚ùå Tavily API limit exceeded
‚ùå Workflow crashed with error: 'task_runner'
```

**Conclusion:** Code is connected, but workflow fails when actually executed!

---

## üìä ACTUAL STATUS BY COMPONENT

### 1. AI Provider Integration
**Status:** ‚úÖ **CONNECTED** but ‚ö†Ô∏è **RUNTIME ISSUES**

**What Works:**
- ‚úÖ [`ClaudeProvider`](axiom/integrations/ai_providers/claude_provider.py) initializes
- ‚úÖ [`get_layer_provider()`](axiom/integrations/ai_providers/__init__.py) returns correct provider
- ‚úÖ AI providers configured for different layers

**What Fails:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Task runner node crashes during execution
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Error handling not catching failures gracefully
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No fallback when AI calls fail

**Actual Integration:** 70% (connected but unstable)

### 2. LangGraph Workflow
**Status:** ‚úÖ **WIRED** but ‚ö†Ô∏è **EXECUTION FAILS**

**What Works:**
- ‚úÖ Graph structure exists ([`graph.py`](axiom/core/orchestration/graph.py))
- ‚úÖ Nodes call AI providers ([`planner.py`](axiom/core/orchestration/nodes/planner.py:107), [`task_runner.py`](axiom/core/orchestration/nodes/task_runner.py:191))
- ‚úÖ State management implemented

**What Fails:**
- ‚ùå Task runner node crashes with KeyError
- ‚ùå Graph doesn't complete execution
- ‚ùå Error handling inadequate

**Actual Integration:** 60% (structure exists, execution fails)

### 3. Search Tool Integration (Tavily)
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **INTEGRATED BUT API LIMIT HIT**

**What Works:**
- ‚úÖ [`TavilyClient`](axiom/integrations/search_tools/tavily_client.py) exists
- ‚úÖ Called by task runner

**What Fails:**
- ‚ùå "This request exceeds your plan's set usage limit"
- ‚ùå No graceful degradation when API limit hit
- ‚ùå Workflow crashes instead of handling error

**Actual Integration:** 50% (code works, but API limits block usage)

### 4. DSPy Integration
**Status:** ‚ùå **CODE EXISTS BUT NOT USED IN WORKFLOW**

**What Exists:**
- ‚úÖ [`axiom/dspy_modules/hyde.py`](axiom/dspy_modules/hyde.py) - HyDE module
- ‚úÖ [`axiom/dspy_modules/multi_query.py`](axiom/dspy_modules/multi_query.py) - Multi-query
- ‚úÖ [`axiom/dspy_modules/optimizer.py`](axiom/dspy_modules/optimizer.py) - Optimizer

**What's MISSING:**
- ‚ùå DSPy modules NOT called in [`planner.py`](axiom/core/orchestration/nodes/planner.py)
- ‚ùå DSPy NOT used in [`task_runner.py`](axiom/core/orchestration/nodes/task_runner.py)
- ‚ùå No DSPy optimization in actual workflow execution
- ‚ùå Just placeholder code that exists but isn't executed

**Actual Integration:** 10% (code exists, not used in workflow)

### 5. Quantitative Models
**Status:** ‚úÖ **CODE EXISTS** but ‚ùå **NOT INTEGRATED INTO AI WORKFLOW**

**What Exists:**
- ‚úÖ 49 quantitative models implemented
- ‚úÖ Can be called directly via ModelFactory

**What's MISSING:**
- ‚ùå NOT used in LangGraph workflow
- ‚ùå NOT integrated with AI analysis
- ‚ùå NOT called by planner/task_runner/observer nodes
- ‚ùå Separate from AI research workflow

**Actual Integration:** 0% (models exist but not used by AI workflow)

---

## üö® CRITICAL FINDINGS

### The Real Problem

**We have TWO separate systems:**
1. **AI Research Workflow** (LangGraph + AI providers) - Partially working
2. **Quantitative Models** (49 models) - Standalone, not integrated

**They Don't Talk to Each Other!**

The AI workflow doesn't use the quantitative models.  
The quantitative models don't use the AI workflow.  
DSPy exists but isn't called by anything.

---

## ‚úÖ WHAT ACTUALLY WORKS RIGHT NOW

### Working (Verified)
1. ‚úÖ AI providers initialize (Claude, SGLang)
2. ‚úÖ LangGraph workflow starts
3. ‚úÖ Planner node executes
4. ‚úÖ Quantitative models can be called directly (standalone)
5. ‚úÖ Database containers run
6. ‚úÖ MCP servers start

### Broken (Just Discovered)
1. ‚ùå LangGraph workflow crashes in task_runner
2. ‚ùå Tavily API limit prevents search
3. ‚ùå DSPy not actually used in workflow
4. ‚ùå Quantitative models not integrated with AI
5. ‚ùå No end-to-end AI + Quant analysis working

## üìã WHAT'S ACTUALLY NEEDED

### Phase 1: Fix Existing Integrations (1-2 weeks)

**Fix AI Workflow:**
1. [ ] Fix task_runner node crash
2. [ ] Add proper error handling for API failures  
3. [ ] Handle Tavily API limits gracefully
4. [ ] Make workflow complete successfully

**Integrate DSPy:**
1. [ ] Actually CALL DSPy in planner node (query expansion)
2. [ ] Actually USE DSPy in task runner (HyDE)
3. [ ] Connect DSPy optimization to workflow
4. [ ] Prove DSPy improves results

**Integrate Quantitative Models with AI:**
1. [ ] Call quantitative models FROM AI workflow
2. [ ] Use VaR in risk assessment node
3. [ ] Use portfolio models in analysis
4. [ ] Create unified AI + Quant pipeline

### Phase 2: Validation (4-6 weeks)

**Test with Real Data:**
1. [ ] Run complete M&A analysis (end-to-end)
2. [ ] Verify AI + DSPy + LangGraph produces good results
3. [ ] Validate quantitative model accuracy
4. [ ] Benchmark against baseline (simple prompts)

### Phase 3: Production Hardening (4-6 weeks)

**Make It Reliable:**
1. [ ] Handle all error cases
2. [ ] Add fallbacks for API failures
3. [ ] Implement retry logic
4. [ ] Add comprehensive logging
5. [ ] Create monitoring dashboards

## üéØ HONEST CURRENT STATE

**What's Done:**
- ‚úÖ Code structure created
- ‚úÖ Modules connected (imports work)
- ‚úÖ Tests pass (syntax/structure)
- ‚úÖ Basic initialization works

**What's NOT Done:**
- ‚ùå AI workflow doesn't complete successfully
- ‚ùå DSPy not actually used
- ‚ùå Quantitative models not integrated with AI
- ‚ùå External API limits block usage
- ‚ùå Runtime errors prevent end-to-end execution
- ‚ùå No validation that it produces good results

**Production Ready:** ‚ùå **NO**  
**Integrated:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIALLY** (code connected, execution fails)  
**Validated:** ‚ùå **NO** (can't validate since it crashes)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

**Priority 1: Make AI Workflow Actually Work**
1. Fix task_runner crash
2. Handle Tavily API errors gracefully
3. Get end-to-end workflow completing
4. Verify AI produces coherent output

**Priority 2: Actually Use DSPy**
1. Call DSPy modules in workflow
2. Show DSPy optimization works
3. Prove value with metrics

**Priority 3: Integrate Quant Models with AI**
1. Call models from AI nodes
2. Combine AI analysis with quantitative results
3. Create unified output

**Estimated:** 2-4 weeks to get basic working integration  
**Then:** 4-6 weeks validation before production

You were absolutely right - we're only at integration stage, and even that has issues!
