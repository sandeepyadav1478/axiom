- Options: 8 models
- Credit: 12 models
- M&A: 8 models

**Code:** ~14,000 lines ML implementations  
**Research:** 60% implemented (35 of 58+ papers)  
**Integration:** Complete - models actively used in LangGraph workflow

**Mature Tools Integrated:**
- TA-Lib (150+ indicators)
- PyPortfolioOpt (proven algorithms)
- QuantLib (institutional pricing)
- QuantStats (50+ metrics)
- MLflow (tracking + registry)
- Evidently (drift detection)
