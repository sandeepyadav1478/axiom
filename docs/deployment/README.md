# AWS Deployment Guide for M&A Workflows

## 🔮 **Future Implementation: Cost-Free AWS Deployment**

> **📝 REMINDER FOR FUTURE**: The current M&A workflows can be adapted to run on **AWS Free Tier** to eliminate GitHub Actions costs while maintaining all functionality.

### **🚀 Planned AWS Free Tier Architecture**

#### **AWS Lambda Functions** (1M free requests/month)
```
M&A Workflow Components → AWS Lambda Functions:
├── target-screening-lambda    # Target identification and screening
├── financial-dd-lambda        # Financial due diligence analysis
├── commercial-dd-lambda       # Commercial due diligence analysis
├── operational-dd-lambda      # Operational due diligence analysis
├── dcf-valuation-lambda       # DCF analysis and modeling
├── comparable-analysis-lambda # Comparable company analysis
├── synergy-analysis-lambda    # Synergy quantification
└── risk-assessment-lambda     # Risk assessment and management
```

#### **EC2 Free Tier** (750 hours/month t2.micro)
```
Long-Running M&A Processes → EC2 t2.micro:
├── comprehensive-dd-runner    # Full due diligence coordination
├── valuation-model-builder   # Complex financial modeling
├── portfolio-analytics       # Executive dashboard generation
└── integration-planner       # PMI planning and coordination
```

#### **AWS Storage & Services** (Free Tier Limits)
```
Supporting Infrastructure:
├── S3 (5GB free)             # M&A analysis results and artifacts
├── CloudWatch (10 metrics)   # Monitoring and alerting
├── EventBridge (free)        # Workflow orchestration
├── SQS (1M requests)         # Message queuing for workflow coordination
└── DynamoDB (25GB)          # Deal tracking and portfolio management
```

### **💰 Cost Comparison**

| Platform | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| **GitHub Actions** | $50-200 | $600-2400 | Pay per execution minute |
| **AWS Free Tier** | $0 | $0 | Within free tier limits |
| **Enterprise Platform** | $8,000+ | $100,000+ | Traditional workflow platforms |

### **🎯 Implementation Plan (Future)**

#### **Phase 1: Lambda Migration**
- Convert M&A workflow functions to AWS Lambda handlers
- Create SAM (Serverless Application Model) templates
- Set up API Gateway for workflow triggering
- Implement S3 storage for analysis artifacts

#### **Phase 2: EC2 Integration** 
- Deploy long-running workflows to EC2 t2.micro instances
- Set up auto-scaling for high-volume periods
- Implement CloudWatch monitoring and alerting
- Create executive dashboard web interface

#### **Phase 3: Full AWS Integration**
- Integrate with AWS financial services (if applicable)
- Set up multi-region deployment for global access
- Implement advanced monitoring and cost optimization
- Create automated backup and disaster recovery

### **📋 AWS Migration Checklist (For Future)**
- [ ] Convert Python workflows to Lambda-compatible functions
- [ ] Create SAM templates for infrastructure as code
- [ ] Set up AWS IAM roles and security policies
- [ ] Implement API Gateway for workflow triggering
- [ ] Create S3 buckets for artifact storage
- [ ] Set up CloudWatch monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Deploy to AWS free tier accounts
- [ ] Create cost monitoring and usage alerts
- [ ] Document AWS deployment procedures
- [ ] Train team on AWS-based M&A workflow execution

**💡 Key Advantage:** AWS free tier deployment will provide the same enterprise-grade M&A workflow capabilities at **zero cost** instead of GitHub Actions execution fees, making it perfect for cost-conscious implementations.

**📅 Future Implementation:** When ready, the existing M&A workflow system can be seamlessly migrated to AWS infrastructure with minimal code changes.
