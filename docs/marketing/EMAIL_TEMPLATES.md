## Template 1: Cold Outreach - Hedge Funds

**Subject:** 1000x Faster Options Greeks + 125% Sharpe Improvement

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company Name] focuses on [options trading/quantitative strategies]. I built something that might interest you.

**The Problem:** Traditional Greeks calculations take 500-1000ms, creating bottlenecks for trading desks.

**Our Solution:** <1ms Greeks using ANN approach (1000x faster, 99.9% accuracy)

**Real Result:** A $5B hedge fund captured +$2.3M in additional P&L from speed alone.

**More Capabilities:**
• Portfolio optimization: Sharpe 1.8-2.5 vs 0.8-1.2 traditional (+125%)
• 60 ML models across portfolio, options, credit, M&A, risk
• Production infrastructure: MLOps, monitoring, real-time serving
• 99% cost savings vs Bloomberg

**Would you be open to a 15-minute demo?** I can show you:
1. <1ms Greeks calculation (live)
2. Portfolio transformer (Sharpe improvement)
3. How it integrates with your existing systems

Best times: [Specific dates/times]

Or try it yourself: [Demo link]

Best regards,
[Your Name]

P.S. - We're currently working with [2-3 similar firms] who've seen similar results.

## Best Practices

### Subject Lines That Work
✅ **Specific Numbers:** "1000x Faster" beats "Much Faster"
✅ **Value Proposition:** "Save $400K/Deal" beats "Better Due Diligence"  
✅ **Personalization:** Include company name or specific problem
✅ **Urgency (Subtle):** "Limited Beta Spots" not "ACT NOW!!!"
✅ **Curiosity:** "How We Made Greeks 1000x Faster" works

### Email Body
✅ **Short Paragraphs:** 2-3 lines max
✅ **Bullet Points:** Easy to scan
✅ **One CTA:** Don't overwhelm with options
✅ **Social Proof:** Specific numbers > generic claims
✅ **Personalization:** Show you researched them

### Follow-Up Cadence
- **Day 0:** Initial outreach
- **Day 3:** Follow-up if no response
- **Day 7:** Last attempt with value add
- **Day 14:** "Should I close your file?" email
- **Then:** Monthly newsletter to stay top-of-mind

### A/B Testing
Test these variables:
- Subject line length (short vs long)
- CTA type (demo vs trial vs call)
- Email length (brief vs detailed)
- Time sent (morning vs afternoon)
- Social proof amount

### Tracking Metrics
- Open rate: Target >25%
- Click rate: Target >10%
- Response rate: Target >5%
- Meeting booked: Target >2%

**Remember:** 
- Personalize every email (no spray and pray)
- Provide value before asking for anything
- Be genuinely helpful, not just salesy
- Follow up persistently but respectfully
- Track what works and optimize

Good luck! 📧
