## Post 2: Technical Deep Dive

**⚡ How We Made Options Greeks Calculations 1000x Faster**

Traditional options pricing uses finite difference methods:
❌ 500-1000ms per calculation
❌ Computationally expensive
❌ Bottleneck for trading desks

Axiom's ANN Greeks Calculator:
✅ <1ms calculation time
✅ 99.9% accuracy vs Black-Scholes
✅ Real-time capability for 50,000+ options

**The Technical Approach:**

1. **Architecture:** Feed-forward neural network
   - Input: S, K, T, r, σ
   - Output: Δ, Γ, Θ, ν, ρ
   - Hidden layers: [128, 256, 128]

2. **Training:** 1M synthetic options scenarios
   - Black-Scholes as ground truth
   - Multiple strike/maturity combinations
   - Various volatility regimes

3. **Deployment:** 
   - Model caching for performance
   - Batch inference engine
   - FastAPI endpoints

**Real Impact:**
• Processing 50,000 options: 50 seconds vs 14 hours
• Hedge fund captured $2.3M in additional P&L
• Zero missed trading opportunities

Research → Production in action.

## Post 4: Technical Team Building

**🔧 Building a Production ML System: Lessons Learned**

Over 12 months, I built Axiom - 60 ML models with complete production infrastructure.

Here are 10 hard-earned lessons:

**1. Research ≠ Production**
Papers give you 20% of what you need. The other 80% is infrastructure, monitoring, error handling, scaling.

**2. Cache Everything**
Model loading is expensive. LRU cache reduced latency from 500ms to <10ms.

**3. Observability is Non-Negotiable**
Prometheus + Grafana + custom dashboards. You can't fix what you can't see.

**4. Feature Stores Save Lives**
Feast reduced feature serving from 100ms to <10ms. Consistency across train/serve critical.

**5. Test in Production-Like Environments**
Docker Compose locally, Kubernetes for staging/production. Catch deployment issues early.

**6. Leverage Existing Tools**
Used TA-Lib, QuantLib, PyPortfolioOpt. Don't reinvent 30 years of domain knowledge.

**7. Security from Day One**
JWT auth, API keys, RBAC, rate limiting. Not an afterthought.

**8. Client Interface Matters**
The best model is useless with a bad UI. Built 15+ dashboards, reports, terminals.

**9. Continuous Research Pipeline**
Implemented 58+ papers. Need systematic paper → production process.

**10. Performance Budget Everything**
<1ms Greeks, <10ms features, <100ms end-to-end. Every millisecond matters in finance.

**Tech Stack:**
• ML: PyTorch, scikit-learn
• Orchestration: LangGraph, DSPy  
• MLOps: MLflow, Feast, Evidently
• Infrastructure: Kubernetes, Docker, FastAPI
• Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana

Building production ML systems is 20% modeling, 80% engineering.
