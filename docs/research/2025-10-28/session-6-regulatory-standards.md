## 1. Basel III/IV Capital Requirements

### Overview
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) provides international regulatory framework for banks and financial institutions focusing on capital adequacy, stress testing, and liquidity risk.

### 1.1 Capital Adequacy Requirements

#### Three-Pillar Framework

**Pillar 1: Minimum Capital Requirements**
- **Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1):** Minimum 4.5% of risk-weighted assets
- **Tier 1 Capital:** Minimum 6% of risk-weighted assets
- **Total Capital:** Minimum 8% of risk-weighted assets
- **Capital Conservation Buffer:** Additional 2.5% above minimum
- **Countercyclical Buffer:** 0-2.5% during periods of excess credit growth

**Pillar 2: Supervisory Review Process**
- Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP)
- Stress testing requirements
- Concentration risk assessment
- Interest rate risk in banking book

**Pillar 3: Market Discipline**
- Public disclosure requirements
- Risk management framework transparency
- Capital structure disclosure

#### Basel IV Enhancements (2023-2028 Phase-in)
- Revised standardized approaches for credit risk
- Output floor: 72.5% of RWA calculated under internal models
- Operational risk: Standardized measurement approach
- Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) risk framework
- Market risk: Fundamental Review of Trading Book (FRTB)

### 1.2 Market Risk - Value at Risk (VaR)

#### VaR Requirements
- **Confidence Level:** 99% (one-tailed)
- **Holding Period:** 10 trading days
- **Observation Period:** Minimum 1 year historical data
- **Update Frequency:** At least quarterly, daily for active trading

#### VaR Methodologies Accepted
1. **Historical Simulation**
   - Non-parametric approach
   - Uses actual historical returns
   - No distribution assumptions

2. **Variance-Covariance (Parametric)**
   - Assumes normal distribution
   - Linear relationship between portfolio value and risk factors
   - Computationally efficient

3. **Monte Carlo Simulation**
   - Generates random scenarios
   - Handles non-linear instruments
   - Most flexible but computationally intensive

#### Backtesting Requirements
- Daily backtesting of VaR model
- Green zone: 0-4 exceptions per year (acceptable)
- Yellow zone: 5-9 exceptions (requires investigation)
- Red zone: 10+ exceptions (model inadequate)

### 1.3 Credit Risk

#### Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) Approach
- **Foundation IRB:** Banks estimate PD, supervisors provide LGD and EAD
- **Advanced IRB:** Banks estimate PD, LGD, and EAD

**Key Metrics:**
- **Probability of Default (PD):** Likelihood of default within one year
- **Loss Given Default (LGD):** Severity of loss if default occurs
- **Exposure at Default (EAD):** Outstanding amount at default
- **Maturity (M):** Effective maturity of exposure

**Risk-Weighted Asset Calculation:**
```
RWA = EAD × LGD × K × 12.5
Where K = capital requirement function based on PD, LGD, M
```

#### Standardized Approach
- External credit ratings (S&P, Moody's, Fitch)
- Risk weights: 0%, 20%, 50%, 100%, 150%
- Sovereign: 0% (AAA to AA-), 20% (A+ to A-)
- Banks: Preferential treatment based on sovereign rating
- Corporate: 20% (AAA to AA-), 100% (BB+ to BB-), 150% (below BB-)

### 1.4 Operational Risk Capital

#### Standardized Measurement Approach (SMA)
- **Business Indicator (BI):** Gross income measure
- **Business Indicator Component (BIC):** Progressive marginal coefficients
  - Bucket 1 (≤€1bn): 12%
  - Bucket 2 (€1bn-€30bn): 15%
  - Bucket 3 (>€30bn): 18%
- **Internal Loss Multiplier (ILM):** Adjusts for institution's loss experience

**Operational Risk Capital = BIC × ILM**

#### Key Operational Risk Categories
1. Internal fraud
2. External fraud
3. Employment practices and workplace safety
4. Clients, products, and business practices
5. Damage to physical assets
6. Business disruption and system failures
7. Execution, delivery, and process management

### 1.5 Liquidity Requirements

#### Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)
- **Minimum Requirement:** 100%
- **Formula:** High-Quality Liquid Assets / Net Cash Outflows (30 days)

- **Level 2A Assets:** Corporate bonds, covered bonds (15% haircut)
- **Level 2B Assets:** RMBS, equities (25-50% haircut)

**Implementation:**
```python
def calculate_lcr(hqla: float, net_outflows: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculate Liquidity Coverage Ratio
    
    Args:
        hqla: High-Quality Liquid Assets
        net_outflows: Expected net cash outflows over 30 days
    
    Returns:
        LCR as percentage
    """
    return (hqla / net_outflows) * 100
```

#### Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)
- **Minimum Requirement:** 100%
- **Formula:** Available Stable Funding / Required Stable Funding
- **Time Horizon:** One year structural ratio
- **Purpose:** Reduces reliance on short-term wholesale funding

**Available Stable Funding (ASF) Factors:**

## 3. IFRS Financial Reporting

### 3.1 IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments

#### Classification and Measurement

**Business Model Test:**
1. **Amortized Cost** - Hold to collect contractual cash flows
2. **FVOCI** - Hold to collect and sell (debt instruments)
3. **FVTPL** - All other business models

**SPPI Test (Solely Payments of Principal and Interest):**
- Contractual cash flows must represent only:
  - Principal repayment
  - Interest (time value of money + credit risk compensation)
- No leverage, prepayment with more than insignificant penalties
- Non-recourse features carefully evaluated

#### Classification Decision Tree
```

              ↓
            Fail
              ↓
           FVTPL
```

#### Impairment Model - Expected Credit Loss (ECL)

**Three Stages:**

**Stage 1: 12-Month ECL**
- No significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition
- Expected losses over next 12 months
- Interest revenue on gross carrying amount

**Stage 2: Lifetime ECL**
- Significant increase in credit risk
- Not credit-impaired
- Expected losses over remaining life
- Interest revenue on gross carrying amount

**Stage 3: Credit-Impaired**
- Objective evidence of impairment
- Lifetime ECL
- Interest revenue on amortized cost (net)

**ECL Calculation:**
```
ECL = PD × LGD × EAD × Discount Factor

Where:
- PD: Probability of Default (forward-looking)
- LGD: Loss Given Default (recovery rate applied)
- EAD: Exposure at Default
- Multiple scenarios weighted by probability
```

#### Hedge Accounting

**Qualifying Hedging Relationships:**
1. Hedging instrument identified
2. Hedged item identified
3. Formal documentation
4. Economic relationship exists
5. Credit risk not dominating

**Types:**
- **Fair Value Hedge:** Hedging fair value changes
- **Cash Flow Hedge:** Hedging variability in cash flows
- **Net Investment Hedge:** Foreign operation hedges

**Effectiveness Testing:**
- Prospective: Expected to be effective
- Retrospective: Actual effectiveness (80-125% no longer required)
- Rebalancing permitted if risk ratio changes

### 3.2 IFRS 13 - Fair Value Measurement

#### Fair Value Definition
"The price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date."

#### Fair Value Hierarchy

**Level 1: Quoted Prices**
- Active markets
- Identical assets/liabilities
- Unadjusted prices
- Examples: Listed stocks, exchange-traded derivatives

**Level 2: Observable Inputs**
- Quoted prices for similar assets
- Quoted prices in inactive markets
- Observable inputs (interest rates, yield curves)
- Corroborated market data
- Examples: Corporate bonds, OTC derivatives

**Level 3: Unobservable Inputs**
- Entity's own assumptions
- Best information available
- Market participant perspective
- Examples: Private equity, complex derivatives

#### Valuation Techniques

**Market Approach:**
- Comparable transactions
- Market multiples (P/E, EV/EBITDA)
- Matrix pricing

**Income Approach:**
- Discounted cash flow (DCF)
- Option pricing models (Black-Scholes, binomial)
- Multi-period excess earnings

**Cost Approach:**
- Replacement cost
- Current reproduction cost
- Depreciation/obsolescence adjustments

#### Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) / Debit Valuation Adjustment (DVA)

**CVA** - Adjustment for counterparty credit risk:
```
CVA = LGD × Σ [EE(t) × PD(t-1, t) × DF(t)]

Where:
- EE(t): Expected Exposure at time t
- PD(t-1, t): Probability of default between t-1 and t
- DF(t): Discount factor
- LGD: Loss Given Default
```

**DVA** - Adjustment for own credit risk:
```
DVA = LGD × Σ [NE(t) × PD_own(t-1, t) × DF(t)]

Where:
- NE(t): Negative Expected Exposure (liability to counterparty)
- PD_own: Own probability of default
```

### 3.3 IFRS 7 - Financial Instruments Disclosures

#### Quantitative Disclosures

**Risk Exposures:**
- Credit risk concentrations
- Maximum credit exposure
- Collateral held
- Credit quality
- Market risk sensitivity analysis
- Liquidity risk maturity analysis

**Fair Value:**
- Fair value hierarchy disclosures
- Level 3 reconciliations
- Valuation techniques and inputs
- Transfers between levels
- Sensitivity analysis (Level 3)

**Hedge Accounting:**
- Risk management strategy
- Hedging instruments
- Hedged items
- Hedge effectiveness
- Sources of ineffectiveness

#### Qualitative Disclosures

**Risk Management:**
- Objectives, policies, and processes
- Methods to measure risk
- Changes from prior period
- Risk concentrations

**Credit Risk:**
- Credit risk management policies
- Methods to assess credit quality
- Definition of default
- Write-off policy
- ECL measurement approaches
