### Paper 2: Systematic Literature Review on ML-Based EVT for Investment Risk
- **Title:** Modeling of Machine Learning-Based Extreme Value Theory in Stock Investment Risk Prediction: A Systematic Literature Review
- **Authors:** M Melina, Sukono, H Napitupulu, N Mohamed
- **Journal:** Big Data, 2025
- **Published:** June 4, 2025
- **DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1089/big.2023.0004
- **Citations:** 672 / 2

**Key Research Findings:**

1. **Literature Coverage:**
   - Systematic review using PRISMA methodology
   - 1,107 articles identified initially
   - 236 articles in eligibility stage
   - 90 articles in final included studies
   - Bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer

2. **Current VaR Methodologies Identified:**
   - Extreme Value Theory (EVT) - reliable for univariate cases, complicated for multivariate
   - GARCH models (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity)
   - Historical simulation
   - **Finding:** ML-based VaR estimation is currently underutilized in practice

3. **Critical Research Gaps:**
   - **No existing research combining EVT with ML for investment risk estimation**
   - Most studies focus on traditional statistical methods
   - High-frequency data analysis is important but underexplored with ML
   - Multivariate cases remain challenging

4. **Recommended Hybrid Approach:**
   - Combination of EVT + GARCH + Machine Learning
   - This hybrid model shows promise for better risk estimation
   - Can handle:
     - Extreme values (tail risk)
     - Volatility clustering (GARCH component)
     - Non-linear patterns (ML component)
     - High-frequency data

5. **Technical Considerations:**
   - Stock prices exhibit:
     - Rapid fluctuations
     - Extreme values
     - Non-linear behavior
     - Need for high-frequency data processing
   - EVT detects extreme values effectively
   - GARCH handles volatility modeling
   - ML captures complex non-linear relationships

**Implications for Implementation:**
- Modern VaR systems should integrate ML with traditional methods
- Pure ML approaches are insufficient without theoretical grounding
- Hybrid models (EVT-GARCH-ML) represent state-of-the-art
- High-frequency data processing capabilities are essential
