## WHAT TO DO NEXT

**Option 1:** Continue research implementation (36% of papers remain)  
**Option 2:** Performance testing and benchmarking  
**Option 3:** Production deployment and hardening  
**Option 4:** Integration refinement and optimization

**Recommended:** Test actual end-to-end workflows with real data to validate the 37 models work correctly.
