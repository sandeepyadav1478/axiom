"""
Automated Credit Underwriting Workflow

Real production credit workflow using our 20 credit models:
1. Receive application
2. Run 20 credit models in parallel
3. Calculate consensus score
4. Generate approval recommendation
5. Create credit committee report

70-80% time savings vs manual underwriting.
